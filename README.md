# Description

Hey! Thanks for checking out my project. Basically it's a machine learning project I made to predict Laker game outcomes for the 2025/2026 season. 
I plan on adding new features to it as time goes on but right now it's somewhat bare bones. Frontent is fully vibe coded, but I plan on going back and updating it (Think NBA jam theme).
Also I added a broken or not broken section at the bottom of this so you can see if the current verison is fully functioning or not. If it's broken while you're reading this and want to
demo it just message me and I can send you a working version!
